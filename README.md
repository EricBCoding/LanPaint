# LanPaint

Powerful Training Free Inpainting Tool Works for Every SD Model. Official Implementation of "Lanpaint: Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting with Exact and Fast Conditional Inference".

## Features

- üé® **Zero-Training Inpainting** - Works immediately with ANY SD model, even custom models you've trained yourself
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple Integration** - Same workflow as standard ComfyUI KSampler
- üöÄ **Quality Enhancements** - High quality and seamless inpainting

Each example includes:
- Original masked image
- Full ComfyUI workflow


## Quickstart

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started).
1. Install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)
1. Look up this extension in ComfyUI-Manager. If you are installing manually, clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
1. Restart ComfyUI.


## Installation

1. Place `LanPaint_Nodes.py` in your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder
2. Restart ComfyUI
3. Use like regular KSampler with inpainting workflows

## Usage

**Workflow Setup**  
Same as default ComfyUI KSampler - simply replace with LanPaint KSampler nodes. The inpainting workflow is the same as the [SetLatentNoiseMask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/zh/comfyui-nodes/latent/inpaint/set-latent-noise-mask) inpainting workflow.

**Note**
LanPaint only support binary mask (0,1) with no smoothing. Any mask with smooting will be converted to binary mask during inpainting.



## Advanced Options (Optional)

Fine-tune results with these key parameters:

| Parameter | Typical Range | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `NumSteps` | 1-10 | Thinking iterations per step |
| `Lambda` | 4-8 | Content preservation strength |
| `StepSize` | 0.05-0.2 | Detail refinement intensity |
