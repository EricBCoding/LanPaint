# LanPaint

Unlock precise inpainting without additional training. LanPaint lets the model "think" through multiple iterations before denoising, aiming for seamless and accurate results. This is the official implementation of "Lanpaint: Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting with Exact and Fast Conditional Inference".

## Features

- üé® **Zero-Training Inpainting** - Works immediately with ANY SD model, even custom models you've trained yourself
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple Integration** - Same workflow as standard ComfyUI KSampler
- üöÄ **Quality Enhancements** - High quality and seamless inpainting

Each example includes:
- Original masked image
- Full ComfyUI workflow


## Quickstart

1. **Install ComfyUI**: Follow the official [ComfyUI installation guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started) to set up ComfyUI on your system.  
2. **Install ComfyUI-Manager**: Add the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) for easy extension management.  
3. **Install LanPaint Nodes**:  
   - **Via ComfyUI-Manager**: Search for "LanPaint" in the manager and install it directly.  
   - **Manually**: Click "Install via Git URL" in ComfyUI-Manager and input the GitHub repository link:  
     ```
     https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint.git
     ```  
     Alternatively, clone this repository into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.  
4. **Restart ComfyUI**: Restart ComfyUI to load the LanPaint nodes.  

Once installed, you'll find the LanPaint nodes under the "sampling" category in ComfyUI. Use them just like the default KSampler for high-quality inpainting!

## Usage

**Workflow Setup**  
Same as default ComfyUI KSampler - simply replace with LanPaint KSampler nodes. The inpainting workflow is the same as the [SetLatentNoiseMask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/zh/comfyui-nodes/latent/inpaint/set-latent-noise-mask) inpainting workflow.

**Note**
- LanPaint requires binary masks (values of 0 or 1) without opacity or smoothing. To ensure compatibility, set the mask's **opacity and hardness to maximum** in your mask editor. During inpainting, any mask with smoothing or gradients will automatically be converted to a binary mask.
- LanPaint relies heavily on your text prompts to guide inpainting - explicitly describe the content you want generated in the masked area. If results show artifacts or mismatched elements, counteract them with targeted negative prompts.

### Basic Sampler
![Samplers](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/Nodes.JPG)  
**LanPaint KSampler**  
Simplified interface with recommended defaults:

- Steps: 50+ recommended
- LanPaint NumSteps: 1-10 (complexity of edits)
- Built-in parameter presets

**LanPaint KSampler (Advanced)**  
Full parameter control:
## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `Steps` | 0-100 | Total steps of diffusion sampling. Higher means better inpainting. Recommend 50. |
| `LanPaint_NumSteps` | 0-20 | Reasoning iterations per denoising step ("thinking depth") |
| `LanPaint_Lambda` | 0.1-50 | Content alignment strength (higher = stricter) |
| `LanPaint_cfg_BIG` | 0-20 | CFG scale used when aligning masked and unmasked region (higher = better alignment). |

For detailed descriptions of each parameter, simply hover your mouse over the corresponding input field to view tooltips with additional information.



## LanPaint KSampler (Advanced) Tuning Guide
For challenging inpainting tasks:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Primary Adjustments**:
- Increase **steps**, **LanPaint_NumSteps** (thinking iterations), and **LanPaint_cfg_BIG** (guidance scale).
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Secondary Tweaks**:  
- Boost **LanPaint_Lambda** (spatial constraint strength) or **LanPaint_StepSize** (denoising aggressiveness).
    
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Balance Speed vs Stability**:  
- Reduce **LanPaint_Friction** to prioritize faster results with fewer "thinking" steps (*may risk instability*).  
- Increase **LanPaint_Tamed** (noise normalization onto a sphere) or **LanPaint_Alpha** (constraint the friction of underdamped Langevin dynamics) to suppress artifacts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**:  
- Optimal parameters vary depending on the **model** and the **size of the inpainting area**.  
- For effective tuning, **fix the seed** and adjust parameters incrementally while observing the results. This helps isolate the impact of each setting.
